Exploring the world of flutter with this new jsonPlaceholder API

- First I created dataProvider Class which will fire the request and notifyListener to update my code when fetching is done
- I Made three screens -> WalkThrough Screen, SignUp Screen and Feed Screen
- I have used jsonPlaceHolder API to get data using http (package)
- I have used it because to show the API Calling in Flutter
- These three screens have a great UI
